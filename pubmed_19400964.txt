AB  - BACKGROUND: Learning strategies are thinking tools that students can use to 
      actively acquire information. Examples of learning strategies include mnemonics, 
      charts, and maps. One strategy that may help students master the tsunami of 
      information presented in medical school is the mind map learning strategy. 
      Currently, there is no valid and reliable rubric to grade mind maps and this may 
      contribute to their underutilization in medicine. Because concept maps and mind 
      maps engage learners similarly at a metacognitive level, a valid and reliable 
      concept map assessment scoring system was adapted to form the mind map assessment 
      rubric (MMAR). The MMAR can assess mind map depth based upon concept-links, 
      cross-links, hierarchies, examples, pictures, and colors. The purpose of this 
      study was to examine interrater reliability of the MMAR. METHODS: This 
      exploratory study was conducted at a US medical school as part of a larger 
      investigation on learning strategies. Sixty-six (N = 66) first-year medical 
      students were given a 394-word text passage followed by a 30-minute presentation 
      on mind mapping. After the presentation, subjects were again given the text 
      passage and instructed to create mind maps based upon the passage. The mind maps 
      were collected and independently scored using the MMAR by 3 examiners. Interrater 
      reliability was measured using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) 
      statistic. Statistics were calculated using SPSS version 12.0 (Chicago, IL). 
      RESULTS: Analysis of the mind maps revealed the following: concept-links ICC = 
      .05 (95% CI, -.42 to .38), cross-links ICC = .58 (95% CI, .37 to .73), 
      hierarchies ICC = .23 (95% CI, -.15 to .50), examples ICC = .53 (95% CI, .29 to 
      .69), pictures ICC = .86 (95% CI, .79 to .91), colors ICC = .73 (95% CI, .59 to 
      .82), and total score ICC = .86 (95% CI, .79 to .91). CONCLUSION: The high ICC 
      value for total mind map score indicates strong MMAR interrater reliability. 
      Pictures and colors demonstrated moderate to strong interrater reliability. We 
      conclude that the MMAR may be a valid and reliable tool to assess mind maps in 
      medicine. However, further research on the validity and reliability of the MMAR 
      is necessary.
