AB  - Mind mapping stands as a contemporary approach to education, introducing an 
      innovative means of teaching and learning. In current times, this technique is 
      embraced due to its ability to enhance the learning and retention process. This 
      investigation explored the imperative nature of adopting novel educational 
      methodologies such as mind mapping, while also examining its benefits and 
      constraints. During the timeframe spanning from 2000 to 2023, the terms "mind 
      map," "medical education," and "thinking skills" were employed as keywords to 
      conduct searches across nine databases: PubMed, Cochrane, Web of Sciences, 
      Science Direct, ProQuest, CNHL, Springer, Wiley, and Google Scholar. After 
      conducting searches across the aforementioned databases, a total of 63 articles 
      were retrieved. Following the elimination of duplicated entries and articles that 
      did not align with the predefined inclusion criteria, the examination focused on 
      10 relevant articles. This analysis adhered to the guidelines outlined by the 
      Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) 
      protocol, available at www.prisma-statement.org. The examination revealed a 
      multitude of notable advantages associated with the implementation of mind maps 
      which are classified into three groups (Enhancing Memory and Comprehension, 
      Fostering Intellectual Growth, Streamlining Learning and Teaching). Additionally, 
      two challenges of the studies were mentioned. Considering the positive ratio of 
      merits to challenges, it is anticipated that this educational methodology will be 
      increasingly incorporated into medical education, owing to its paramount 
      importance and potential.
